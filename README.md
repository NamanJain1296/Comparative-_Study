# Comparative_Study
This repository contains the comparison between various machine learing algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree. Random Forest and Support Vector. I compared these regressor algorithms to check which one is best to be implemented. 

## Overview
This comparison has been made on the Real Estate Dataset sourced from Kaggle. It includes various features such as latitude, longitude, distance of MRT stations, etc and the target variable price per unit.
